                <h2>Diary Entry</h2>
                <p>STATE OF CURSOR TODAY AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>

<p>I was vibe coding along with Cursor today.Agent mode.<br />
It was generating a markdown file for each prompt.<br />
In one prompt, I asked it to "give pros and cons of each, lets discuss".<br />
Even then, it went ahead and created a markdown file.<br />
And the same think was in the response of each prompt.<br />
Thats the same content twice, in the output.<br />
Feel like these apps are hardcoded to generate as much text as possible. <br />
Not to mention, each query takes in the whole history again. Each query takes in the whole cumulative contxt .<br />
So lets assume , in theory, there is a chat between two people Q and A.<br />
Lets assume the conversation is liek : Q1,A1,Q2,A2,Q3,A3,Q4,A4.</p>

<p>But with LLMs, the conversation is like Q1,A1,(Q2+Q1),A2,(Q1+Q2+Q3),A3,(Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4),A4.</p>

<p>Bet these companies are justifying their capex spends based on metrics like aggreagte input token count and output otken count.<br />
I know there is a reponses api which can take in previous_response_id but this is not the default in cursor.ITs still on chat completions API.<br />
--------------------------</p>

<p>THis reminds me of one more thing.<br />
US carried out an operation where it abducted a leader of a foreign country.I am talking about Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.<br />
The legal justification hasn't come out yet.<br />
Not imagine, if the same thing had been done by India. There would be condemnation, criticism and public pressure to accept that it was a mistake.<br />
But not with the US. THey can do anything. Their official statement partly read "Strength is the only way to continue peace". Ok, will keep that in mind.</p>

<p>--------------------------</p>

<p>I have decided to speak out when I solve problems and write more while trying to solve.<br />
I used to have a friend Pranjal, he used to scribble a lot. Reminded me of him today.<br />
I feel speaking and writing activate a different part of our brain.</p>

<p>--------------------------</p>

<p>Spoke to my past manager Nischaiy for quite some time friday evening. <br />
He asked me to practice giving interviews more.<br />
His way of high level view of problems, even when one doesnt have the complete details is what I want to pick up.</p>
