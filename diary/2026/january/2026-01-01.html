                <h2>Diary Entry</h2>
                <p>A tribute to our parents.</p>

<p>I was at a night camping place recently. We had settled for the night in our tents around 1am after a <br />
tiring session of dancing ourselves out. It was about 1am and I fell fast asleep. But I was awoken around 2:30am <br />
by the crying noises of a boy. The boy and his parents were in the tent beside ours.</p>

<p>We had noticed the boy in the evening. He was a cute little guy and he was roaming continuously throughout the <br />
evening. But , in the middle of the night, he was crying profusely, saying "I love you amma" and "I love you appa" to <br />
his mother and fasther. His parents were trying to pacify him, trying to ask him if his tummy was hurting. <br />
They offered him some water, trying to tell him some stories about the evening. In the end , the boy fell asleep around 3am.</p>

<p>We didnt try to interfere, we were sure that the parents would take care of their child. But it was a nuissance, we thought.<br />
"These days it's so difficult to have a good time, due to these children, be it in a train, a cinema hall, or in a <br />
night camp,  we thought".</p>

<p>I asked myself why would the parents put their children through these "sessions", when clearly,<br />
there is a very high chance that the child would likely cause inconvenience to people around and also to them.<br />
But then I put myself in the shoes of the parents. I would imagine , a period of 6-8 years in which the child is <br />
cranky more often than not, where the child needs constant care and attention. The parents would have made that particular plan<br />
after very serious consideration, they would have probably thought "its been so long since we went out, <br />
we dont get any time for ourselves anyway". I imagive they would have put off atleast 4-5 prevous plans before they decided <br />
to do this.</p>

<p>Then I thought, our parents have done this. They have gone through the same thing. Then it hit me. how, they must have <br />
sacrificed a good chink of their lives, probably more than atleast 10 years, just for us to be ourselves, just for us.</p>

<p>The next morning, the parents told that they had given a "medicine" in the middle of the night and the boy slept after that.<br />
They said that they thought the body "ran a lot" in the evening and generally communicates well to say what he fells.<br />
They said he was 3 years old and he was a "good boy". Generation these days I thought.</p>

<p>So the next time you are disturbed by a small child crying, spare a thought for the poor parents and thank your parents for what all they have done for you.</p>
